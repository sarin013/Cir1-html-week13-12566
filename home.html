                    Software development is the process of conceiving,
                    specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing,
                    and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining
                    applications, frameworks, or other software components.
                    Software development involves writing and maintaining the
                    source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all
                    processes from the conception of the desired software
                    through the final manifestation, typically in a planned and
                    structured process often overlapping with software
                    engineering. Software development also includes research,
                    new development, prototyping, modification, reuse,
                    re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that
                    result in software products.
